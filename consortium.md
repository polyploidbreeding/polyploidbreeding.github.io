**Project coordinator**: Filippo Biscarini, Ph.D.

My research activities span from plant and animal breeding & genetics, to bioinformatics and biostatistics applications in plant & animal science and human medicine. I worked for the breeding industry, for universities and research centres in many places: Italy, Ireland, Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, Spain, The United Kingdom, Belgium. I am now Senior Scientist at CNR, where I rejoined my research group after a 2-yr secondment at the Data Analysis Team of the ERC (European Research Council).
