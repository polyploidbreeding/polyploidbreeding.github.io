## QGIS TUTORIAL - 2: subsetting an image

We follow up on our previous post on the [basic use of the QGIS software](/knowledge base/2024/05/23/qgis-first.html),
and show now how you can **subset a large image** and extract a small region of it.

From drone phenotyping experiments, orthomosaic image files tend to be quite large, in the order
of **several gigabytes**: large field plots, high resolution (e.g. 1 pixel = 1 meter), multiple channels ... 
your image size quickly skyrockets!

Any operation with such files becomes cumbersome, and you need specialised software, 
like [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/), to do the job.

This holds also when you want to extract a small region from a large image file,
e.g. a single plot from a crop field.

Remeber, when you work with drone-captured images, you typically have at least two files:

- the image file (e.g. .tiff file)
- the shape file (e.g. .shp file), that contains information on the boundaries within the larger image file (e.g. single plots, walkways, water canals etc.)

Optionally, you can also have a .tfw file with geographical coordinates (e.g. latitude, longitude) to **georeference** GeoTIFF **raster image** files.
The tfw file is typically a very small file.
