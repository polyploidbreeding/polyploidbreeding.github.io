## QGIS TUTORIAL - 2: subsetting an image

We follow up on our previous post on the [basic use of the QGIS software](/knowledge base/2024/05/23/qgis-first.html),
and show now how you can **subset a large image** and extract a small region of it.

From drone phenotyping experiments, orthomosaic image files tend to be quite large, in the order
of **several gigabytes**: large field plots, high resolution (e.g. 1 pixel = 1 cm), multiple channels ... 
your image size quickly skyrockets!

Any operation with such files becomes cumbersome, and you need specialised software, 
like [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/), to do the job.

This holds also when you want to extract a small region from a large image file,
e.g. a single plot from a crop field.

Remeber, when you work with drone-captured images, you typically have at least two files:

- the image file (e.g. .tiff file)
- the shape file (e.g. .shp file), that contains information on the boundaries within the larger image file (e.g. single plots, walkways, water canals etc.)

Optionally, you can also have a .tfw file with geographical coordinates (e.g. latitude, longitude) to **georeference** GeoTIFF **raster image** files.
The tfw file is typically a very small file.

### Subsetting images with QGIS

You first need to open your .tif orthomosaic image file with QGIS, and then add the corresponding shape file (already created: [see previous post](/knowledge base/2024/05/23/qgis-first.html)):

From the software menu bar: 

- `Layer` > `Add Layer` > `Add Raster Layer`, and **select the input .tiff/.tif image file**
- `Layer` > `Add Layer` > `Add Vector Layer`, and select as source the **.shp shape file**

<a href="/assets/img/posts/orthomosaic_rgb_image.png"><img src="/assets/img/posts/orthomosaic_rgb_image.png" alt="Example orthomosaic image of an agricultural field"></a>
<div class="caption"><b>Figure</b>: Orthomosaic RGB image file of an agricultural field and its superimposed shape file of individual plots</div>

Now it's time to start subsetting the orthomosaic using the shape file: we will select a few plots and extract them.
To do so, you need to highlight the shape layer, and then click on the button `Select Features by Area or Single Click` from the top menu bar of QGIS.
This will allow you to **select one or multiple** (by pressing the `shift` key) **plots** (e.g. one row) by left-clicking with your mouse: 
the selected shapes will appear in yellow.

You now need to save this new shape file: `Layer` > `Save as` > `FORMAT` = shapefile, then choose a filename and a place in your file system to save it.

With the new shapefile, you can extract the corresponding region/subset of the orthomosaic:

- `Raster` > `Extraction` > `Clip Raster by Mask Layer`
- select the desired `Input layer` (the orthomosaic) and `Mask layer` (the new reduced shape file) and **RUN**!

You will get the following *clipped region* (black shaded) that is your extracted region:

<a href="/assets/img/posts/orthomosaic_subset.png"><img src="/assets/img/posts/orthomosaic_subset.png" alt="Example orthomosaic image of an agricultural field"></a>
<div class="caption"><b>Figure</b>: Clipped orthomosaic image extracted from the newly defined shape file</div>
