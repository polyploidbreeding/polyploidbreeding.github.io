From **Monday 22 April 2024** **Dr. Giulia Moscatelli** will start working on the *Polyploidbreeding* project ([short bio here](/consortium.html) ).
Giulia will join our team at CNR in Milan, and she will be active mainly with the processing and analysis of image-phenotyping and genome-sequencing data on barley, durum and bread wheat.

Her tasks will include:
- the training of neural networks for the automatic extraction of phenotypic traits from 2D and 3D images
- the modelling of genomes with different ploidy (2x, 4x, 6x) for the purpose of genomic predictions
- the subsampling of image data for phenotypic predictions

Welcome to the project, Giulia!
