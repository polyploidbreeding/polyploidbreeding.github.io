**One-year** post-doctoral research job in **biostatistics** (neural network models for plant phenomics and genomics) within the context of the project [Polyploidbreeding 4.0](https://polyploidbreeding.ibba.cnr.it/).
The job is based in Milan (Italy), with flexibility to work from remote.

### Responsibilities

The project will develop machine learning and neural network models for precision agriculture and genomic selection in plant species with different ploidy: *barley* (2n), *durum wheat* (4n) and *bread wheat* (6n).

From field and rhizotron trials, high-throughput image data from RGB, multi-spectral and thermic cameras will be acquired, alongside traditional phenotypes and sequencing/genotyping data, on hundreds of barley, durum and bread wheat accessions. The job holder will join our team in the development of neural network models for the processing of image data for phenotypic and genomic predictions.

### Qualifications

Besides a degree in plant science (or similar fields), a PhD is required and minimum two years of research experience. To carry out the statistical analysis of project data, several scripting languages (e.g. R, Python) and bioinformatic tools will be used: familiarity with coding and the use of analytical frameworks is expected. The working environment will be based on Linux operating systems and remote high-performance computing clusters. A good command of the English language is necessary; knowledge of Italian is a plus.
