On February 10-11 2026, the final meeting of the **Polyploidbreeding** project took place.
We have been graciously hosted by our colleagues at [CREA-GB](https://www.crea.gov.it/web/genomica-e-bioinformatica) in Fiorenzuola:
as the saying goes, *see Fiorenzuola, then die* ;-)

The meeting program was the following:

- social dinner, February 10th
- project meeting at CREA-GB, February 11th: 9:00 - 13:00
- light lunch
