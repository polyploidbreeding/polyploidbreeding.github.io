On February 10-11 2026, the final meeting of the **Polyploidbreeding** project took place.
We have been graciously hosted by our colleagues at [CREA-GB](https://www.crea.gov.it/web/genomica-e-bioinformatica) in Fiorenzuola:
as the saying goes, *see Fiorenzuola, then die* ;-)

The meeting program was the following:

- social dinner, February 10th
- project meeting at CREA-GB, February 11th: 9:00 - 13:00
- light lunch

More specifically, we discussed:

1. general overviews of the project progress: i) the drone phenotyping experiment, ii) the rhizotyron experiment; iii) the SNP genotyping experiment; iv) tool development and data analysis
2. the computer vision work: use directly drone-captured image data to make predictions on target phenotypes (e.g. yield, lodging, heading date)
3. the analysis of root data from the rhizotron experiments + the field trials (shovelomics)
4. the GWAS analysis

**!! Great news: the whole-genome resequencing of durum wheat (tetraploid) and bread wheat (hexaploid) has been completed !!** (more on this soon)

As for ongoing scientific publications:

- "DRONE2REPORT: a configuration-driven multi-sensor pipeline for UAV-based crop phenotyping and precision agriculture" (under review at [Drones](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones))
- work and article on root traits: leader Roberta Rossi
- work and article on computer vision: leaders Nelson Nazzicari & Filippo Biscarini
- work and article on GWAS: leaders Roshan Paudel & Elisabetta Frascaroli
