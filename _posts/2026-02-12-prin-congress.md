On February 12th 2026, a [PRIN plenary congress](https://www.cnr.it/it/evento/20363/la-ricerca-italiana-per-la-sostenibilita-della-filiera-del-frumento-duro) has been organised in Rome.
The objective was to bring together all PRIN 2020-2022 projects on **durum wheat** (*Triticum durum*), to present their work and results.
This of course included our project Polyploidbreeding.
