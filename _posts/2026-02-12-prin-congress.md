On February 12th 2026, a [PRIN plenary congress](https://www.cnr.it/it/evento/20363/la-ricerca-italiana-per-la-sostenibilita-della-filiera-del-frumento-duro) has been organised in Rome,
at the Auditorium "Donat Cattin" in [Via Rieti](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Auditorium+Donat+Cattin/@41.9127788,12.4987449,19.36z/data=!3m1!5s0x132f610f2006ea53:0xcd95e7ec6829a75e!4m6!3m5!1s0x132f610f2001e119:0x771ad3fa9f3b7ae4!8m2!3d41.9124435!4d12.4982322!16s%2Fg%2F11c6wcsxq3?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDIxMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).
The objective was to bring together all PRIN 2020-2022 projects on **durum wheat** (*Triticum durum*), to present their work and results.
This of course included our project Polyploidbreeding.

The conference program was split in:

- morning session on the presentation of results from the twelve PRIN projects on durum wheat
- afternoon session with round tables on durum wheat breeding and management with relevant stakeholders

The congress was also the occasion to present and distribute a booklet (in Italian) on scientific research on quality and sunstainability 
of durum wheat production in Italy (Italian title "La ricerca italiana per la sostenibilità e la qualità della filiera del frumento duro"; 
"Terra è Vita" 03/2026 - VIII.+ 200pp. - ISSN:2421-356X).
