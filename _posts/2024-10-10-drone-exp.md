With the drone-phenotyping experiment, we collected high-resolution image data on barley, durum and bread wheat [trial fields](/_posts/fields.html).
In each field, multiple genotypes were sowed.
We used three cameras (RGB, multi-spectral, thermal) and performed 10 flights over each field to cover the whole growing season (from February to June).

This produced a lot of image data that will be used for:

1. the calculation of **vegetation indices** (e.g. NDVI)
2. the development of DNN (deep neural network models) for **phenotypic predictions**: 
	i) can we use image data to predict yield? 
	ii) can we use early image data to predict future growth?
	iii) can we use lower-resolution data to obtain predictions of comparable accuracy?
3. **genomic predictions**, when coupled with genotyping/sequencing data 

The figure below gives a visual overview of the drone-phenotyping experiment:
