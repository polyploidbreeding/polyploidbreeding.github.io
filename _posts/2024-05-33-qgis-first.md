## QGIS TUTORIAL - 1

With this post, we begin a super-elementary tutorial on the use of the software package [**QGIS**](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) for the processing of
geo-referenced image data: QGIS is a free and open-source framework for geographic information system (GIS) data.

A few introductory assumptions:

- we are focussing on the processing of agricultural field images from drone phenotyping
- the starting point is therefore an **orthomosaic** image file generated by combining multiple overlapping photos taken by a camera mountd on a drone
- we take the standpoint of RGB camera and RGB image files (three channels): things will be a bit different with image data from thermic or multi-spectral cameras
- we used QGIS installed on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux distribution (some details may be a bit different if you use another operating system)
