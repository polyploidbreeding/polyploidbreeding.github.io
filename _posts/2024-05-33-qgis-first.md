## QGIS TUTORIAL - 1

With this post, we begin a super-elementary tutorial on the use of the software package [**QGIS**](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) for the processing of
geo-referenced image data: QGIS is a free and open-source framework for geographic information system (GIS) data.

A few introductory assumptions:

- we are focussing on the processing of agricultural field images from drone phenotyping
- the starting point is therefore an **orthomosaic** image file generated by combining multiple overlapping photos taken by a camera mountd on a drone
- we take the standpoint of RGB camera and RGB image files (three channels): things will be a bit different with image data from thermic or multi-spectral cameras
- we used QGIS installed on a Debian/Ubuntu Linux distribution (some details may be a bit different if you use another operating system)

For the installation of QGIS and for technical details, you can have a look at the official documentation ([here](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)).

### Splitting the orthomosaic in subimages

Let's say that our objective is to extract interesting areas from the orthomosaic: in the case of the **polyploidbreeding project** these will be 
the different field plots where different accessions are planted or treatments applied.

For example, we can look at the image below, where we have three geo-referenced plots that need to be separated for further processing.

<div class="caption"><b>Figure</b>: Example image file of an agricultural field</div>

#### 1. Import the orthomosaic in QGIS

First, we suggest that you **create a QGIS project**: this will make it easier to handle input files, output folders and option setting.
To create a project, once you opened QGIS, you will use the main menu (top bar): 

- i) you click on `Project` > `New`
- ii) `Project` > `Save`: choose a **location** (**directory**) and a **name** where to save the project; this will create a `.qgz` file
- iii) <u>useful tip</u>: go to `Project` > `Properties` and sett the `Project home` folder; this will make it much easier to browse for input/output files and folders
