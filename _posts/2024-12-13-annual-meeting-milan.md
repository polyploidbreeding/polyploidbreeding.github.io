The in-presence 2024 annual meeting of the project "<u>Polyploidbreeding</u>" took place on 13 December 2024 at **CNR** (**Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche**) in Milan.

### Programme

1. Current status of the project
2. Update on genotyping (25k SNP array on ~400 samples) and on whole-genome sequencing (~20 samples) of durum (4x) and bread (6x) wheat
3. Discussion of ongoing activities:
	- drone phenotyping: vegetation indices and traditional phenotypes in wheat (durum, bread) and barley
	- rhizotron experiment (Julich, 15 january - 15 february 2025)
	- field-validation of root traits (Fiorenzuola: seeds have been sown, measurement --shovelomics-- to take place in May 2025)
4. Media check: communication & dissemination
5. The next steps:
	- final project meeting: June 2025, Bologna
	- final conference: [Eucarpia Biometrics in Plant breeding](https://www.eucarpia.eu/eucarpia-meetings/470-19th-meeting-of-the-eucarpia-section-biometrics-in-plant-breeding-2025), Edinburgh, 17-19 September 2025
	- publication strategy
	- scouting for calls for project: the next source of funding for our ideas
