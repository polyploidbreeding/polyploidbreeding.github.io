## Keynote Speech from Polyploidbreeding

On <u>21-22 November 2024</u>, the annual workshop of the **Nordic-Baltic Plant Phenotyping Network** took place
([more details here](https://nordicphenotyping.org/events/registration-for-the-nbppn-workshop-2024/)).

The [Nordic-Baltic Plant Phenotyping Network](https://nordicphenotyping.org/) (NBPPN) is an initiative that
brings together several countries to strengthen the plant phenotyping community in the Nordic-Baltic region.

The **Polyplodbreeding coordinator**, Dr. Filippo Biscarini, was invited by the <u>University of Copenhagen</u>, 
Department of plant and environmental sciences, to give a **keynote speech** at this year's annual workshop,
with the title "**Computer vision for plant phenotyping: the Polyploidbreeding 4.0 project and the AGRI-VISION initiative**".

In summary, the keynote speech covered the following topics:

1. Neural Network models for Computer Vision: 
	- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
	- Self-attention and transformers vs RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)
2. The Polyploidbreeding project:
	- drone phenotyping
	- rhizotron
	- genotyping & sequencing
3. The  [drone2report](https://github.com/ne1s0n/drone2report) software: calculating vegetation indices
4. AGRI-VISION: a proposal for a new [COST Action](https://www.cost.eu/) (submitted on 23rd October 2024)

Several scientists and experts from academia and breeding companies took part in the event:
