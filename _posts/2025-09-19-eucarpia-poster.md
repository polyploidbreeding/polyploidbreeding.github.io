We presented our first results on the completion of the phenotyping experiments at the 
[XIX Eucarpia Conference](https://highlanderlab.github.io/EUCARPIA2025BiometricsPlantBreeding/) 
on "Biometrics in Plant Breeding", Edinburgh, 17-19 September 2025.

For the occasion, we were asked to prepare a poster for the Friday afternoon's session, with title:
"Computer-vision applications in barley and wheat breeding: drone and rhizotron phenotyping" 
(here's the [complete conference programme](https://highlanderlab.github.io/EUCARPIA2025BiometricsPlantBreeding/assets/pdf/EUCARPIA_Programme_Booklet_web.pdf)).

The completed phenotyping experiments include:

- the **drone phenotyping** experiment
- the **traditional phenotyping** experiment
- the **rhizotron** experiment

### The poster in all its beauty

The poster session was hosted in the building of [The Royal College of Physician](https://maps.app.goo.gl/73jkUjuGj2oSzkX17), Edinburgh.
You can find the poster's abstract in the conference's [Book of Abstracts](https://highlanderlab.github.io/EUCARPIA2025BiometricsPlantBreeding/assets/pdf/EUCARPIA_Programme_Booklet_web.pdf) (poster n. 69, poster session 2).
