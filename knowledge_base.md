# Knowledge base

Here we list the posts that fall in the category "knowledge base", where we write something which is related to 
the scientific disciplines covered by the project.

<ul>
{% for post in site.categories.KNOWLEDGE_BASE %}
      <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
